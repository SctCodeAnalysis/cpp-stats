Elapsed time: 11 min 47 seconds

- Mean `maintainability index` is equal to 80. It means that repository is very maintainable.
- Time spend only on coding this project according to `Halstead time required to program` metric is **33 hours**. 
- Most methods are very easy to analyze (`Mean Cognitive complexity` is equal to `1.3`).
- Most methods are very small (`Mean method length` is equal to `8.8`).
- `3D-Renderer` is 22 times simplier to program than `cpp-dotenv` based on `Halstead effort` (`2146831` vs `48412056`).

P.S.
LOC of `3D-Renderer` is `2 342`, LOC of `cpp-dotenv` is `33 741`, but elapsed times are nearly equal. This is because 3D-Renderer has large dependencies - Eigen (Linear algebra) and SFML (simple QT). Third-party libraries does not influence report, but it is necessary to parse them too for correct results.
